Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm a PhD Candidate at the Paris School of Economics and Collège de France at the Farhi Innovation Lab, under the supervision of Philippe Aghion in applied microeconomics. I work on the labour market for researchers in France, as well as the impact of political pressures on research.


Seminar

The Farhi Innovation lab's PhD students co-organise the Brown Bag Seminar of Innovation with Insead once a month. It is held both online and physically at the Collège de France, 3 rue d'Ulm, on Friday mornings. You will find all of the information about upcoming sessions on [our page](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/evenements/brown-bag-economics-of-innovation-seminar/) at the PSE website.
