abstract: 'At the end of the 1990s, recognizing the growing importance of universities in an increasingly globalized,
tertiarized and knowledge-based economy, the countries constituting the European Union made a series of agreements 
aiming at harmonizing and increasing the quality of their national university systems. In France, this process took the 
form of the 2007 university reform aimed at increasing the autonomy of French university in particular in recruitment. 
In this paper, I analyse the effect of the reform on the research productivity and the global allocation of researchers 
in French universities. First, I build a stylised model of search and matching for the French academic market. Second, 
I estimate on bibliometric data the causal effect of the reform on the flows between universities and on the productivity 
of researchers at universities in France. Finally, I use the results of these regressions and  administrative 
employer-employee data to calibrate the model and provide estimates for welfare effects.'
