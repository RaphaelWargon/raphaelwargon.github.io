abstract: 'Since the late 1990s, an increasing number of countries have turned to “illiberal democracy,” 
  a regime that maintains “free but unfair” elections while systematically undermining the rule of law.
  In this paper, we argue that modern illiberal democracies cause detrimental effects on research. 
  Using both national and international bibliometric data, we compare researchers exposed to illiberal policies in 
Hungary with their peers in other Central European countries prior to and after the first re-election of Viktor Orbán in 2010. 
We find that Hungarian researchers increasingly shift their publication efforts toward national-language journals with lower
quality and are more likely to leave the country altogether. We show that political pressure is a key driver of these effects: 
researchers experience radically different patterns in terms of research outcomes depending on their political alignment. 
  Researchers perceived as political opponents are more negatively impacted in both their publication output and in 
collaboration networks, decreasing them both by about a quarter of the pre-shock value per year. Yet, they are more likely 
to publicly criticize the regime. Finally, researchers working on topics related to gender issues are also more affected and 
experience a decrease of 10% of their total publications and of 30% of their publications in top journals. '
